# Griffins Scout

A scouting app designed for FRC by Team 1884 but can be used to scout VEX and FTC.

## Usage

The app consists of four different apps alongside two libraries. Client should be loaded using expo onto all the phones and tablets that will be scouting. Controller, scanner, and viewer should all be running on the same LAN. Viewer is for looking at data. Scanner is for scanning and generating codes and controller handles the server.
